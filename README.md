## SCSS to CSS Compilation Guide

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your computer. If not, download and install them from Node.js.

### Step 2: Install Sass
Open your terminal and run the following command to install Sass globally:

```bash
npm install -g sass

This will make Sass available for use in any of your projects.

Step 3: Write Your SCSS Code
Create a .scss file, for example, styles.scss, and write your SCSS code in this file. Organize your styles as needed.

Step 4: Compile SCSS to CSS
In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your SCSS file and run the following command:

sass styles.scss styles.css

This command instructs Sass to take the styles.scss file and compile it into a CSS file named styles.css.
